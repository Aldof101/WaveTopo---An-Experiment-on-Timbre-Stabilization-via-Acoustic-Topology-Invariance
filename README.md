# WaveTopo---An-Experiment-on-Timbre-Stabilization-via-Acoustic-Topology-Invariance
While creating UTAU voicebanks, I observed that human voices maintain timbre during pitch shifts, whereas synthetic ones distort. Inspired by topology, I hypothesized an acoustic topology invariance in vocals: when pitch (F0) changes, harmonics and formants self-adapt to preserve timbral "shape".
